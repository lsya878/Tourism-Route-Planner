# Tourism-Route-Planner
 A Tamil Nadu Tourism Route Planner built using Graph Theory that visualizes travel paths through tourist spots using DFS, Prim’s, and Dijkstra’s algorithms
## Features:
- Explore all possible routes using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.
- Connect all cities with minimum travel cost **Prim’s Algorithm** **Minimum Spanning Tree**.
- Find the **shortest path** between two cities using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.
- Interactive graph visualization with nodes and weighted edges.
- Step-by-step algorithm execution and highlighting.
  
## How to Use:
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Select an algorithm from **DFS**, **Prim’s**, or **Dijkstra**.
3. For DFS and Dijkstra, choose a **start city**. For Dijkstra, also select an **end city**.
4. Click **Run Algorithm** to see the graph visualization.
5. Use **Previous Step**,**Next Step** to go through the algorithm execution step by step.
6. Click **Reset Graph** to start over.

## Algorithms Used
- **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explores all connected nodes starting from a given city.
- **Prim’s :** Connects all cities with minimum total distance.
- **Dijkstra:** Computes the shortest path between two cities based on edge distances.

## Graph Details
- **Nodes (Cities):**  Chennai, Coimbatore, Erode, Vellore, Pondicherry, Mahabalipuram, Kanchipuram, Yelagiri, Thanjavur, Ooty, Rameswaram, Kanyakumari, Madurai, Trichy, Salem.
- **Edges:** Weighted based on distances between cities.
- **Visualization:** Nodes and edges are interactive and dynamically highlighted during algorithm execution.
